# CBn-end-point-binding

This folder contains parameters and initial conditions for complexes used in our large-scale end-point free energy calculations on the Cucurbit[n]uril (n=7 or 8) host-guest systems.

The atomic-charge files for the CBn hosts and the drug-like guests binding to them can be found in the folders named CB7 and CB8.

The docking-produced initial conditions of host-guest complexes are put in the Dockdata folder.
